# HLS Engineering job Raster

This project implementing a component with help of intel hls tools to rasterize for graphics to VGA-component.

Whit 3 components **VGA_raster**, **hierarchi_part** and **write_pixle**. Implementation of a hierarchical raster for some increase in speed.

A VGA-component with suport to be able to communicate with raster components are not implemented in examples a on-chip memory used as an image buffer.
